            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims,
                such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the
                development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role
                of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that
                education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the
                term. In a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of
                this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as
                the transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals
                increasingly encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society,
                empathy, and complex vocational skills.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education can be characterized from the teacher's or the student's
                perspective. Teacher-centered definitions focus on the perspective and role of the teacher, for example,
                in the form of transmitting knowledge and skills while doing so in a morally appropriate
                manner.[28][4][11] Student-centered definitions, on the other hand, outline education based on the
                student's experience in the learning process, for example, based on how education transforms and
                enriches their subsequent experience.[29][12][30] However, conceptualizations taking both perspectives
                into account are also possible. This can take the form of describing the process as the shared
                experience of a common world that involves discovery as well as posing and solving problems.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Since 1909, the percentage of children in the developing world attending
                school has increased. Before then, a small minority of boys attended school. By the start of the
                twenty-first century, the majority of children in most regions of the world attended some form of
                school.[101] By 2016, over 91 percent of children are enrolled in formal primary schooling.[101]
                However, a learning crisis has emerged across the globe, due to the fact that a large proportion of
                students enrolled in school are not learning. A World Bank study found that "53 percent of children in
                low- and middle-income countries cannot read and understand a simple story by the end of primary
                school."[102] While schooling has increased rapidly over the last few decades, learning has not followed
                suit.</p>
